Keanu\'s father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry.

His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude "Ted Logan" in Bill & Ted\'s Excellent Adventure (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves\'s real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Speed (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Feeling Minnesota (1996) and The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997), and big films like A Walk in the Clouds (1995) and The Devil\'s Advocate (1997).

After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings\' cyberadventure, The Matrix (1999).',

			'bio' => 'Edward Harrison Norton was born on August 18, 1969, in Boston, Massachusetts, and was raised in Columbia, Maryland. From the age of five onward, the Yale graduate (majoring in history) was interested in acting. At the age of eight, he would ask his drama teacher what his motivation in a scene was.

He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee\'s Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, Primal Fear (1996).  Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen\'s Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996).

Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Primal Fear (1996). In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in American History X (1998). This performance would earn him his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actor. In 1999 came the critically acclaimed Fight Club (1999)',

Her father came from a long showbusiness legacy, as the son of actors John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, while her mother was the daughter of Hungarian immigrants. Despite a troubled and much-publicized adolescence, and a string of bad girl parts in lurid crime dramas such as Poison Ivy (1992), Barrymore\'s star was officially on the rise during the mid-1990s, with notable appearances in Boys on the Side (1995), Woody Allen\'s Everyone Says I Love You (1996), and the game-changing horror hit Scream (1996).',

At 17, he took his first step towards becoming a stand-up comedian when he spontaneously took the stage at a Boston comedy club. He found he was a natural comic. He nurtured his talent while at New York University (graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991) by performing regularly in clubs and at universities. 

While working at a comedy club in L.A., he was "discovered" by Dennis Miller, who recommended him to Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels and told him that Sandler had a big talent. This led to his being cast in the show in 1990, which he also wrote for in addition to performing. 

After Saturday Night Live, Sandler went on to the movies, starring in such hit comedies as Airheads (1994), Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison  and Big Daddy.',
