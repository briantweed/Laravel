Keanu\'s father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry.

His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude "Ted Logan" in {{Bill & Ted\'s Excellent Adventure (1989)}}. The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves\'s real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of {{Speed (1994)}}. Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Feeling Minnesota (1996) and The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997), and big films like A Walk in the Clouds (1995) and The Devil\'s Advocate (1997).

After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings\' cyberadventure, {{The Matrix (1999)}}.',

He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee\'s Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, {{Primal Fear (1996)}}.  Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen\'s Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996).

Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in {{Primal Fear (1996). In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in {{American History X (1998)}}.

Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in From Hell.

She is of mostly Irish descent, along with English, German, and French. Her first major role came in the short-lived television series Get Real (1999). She gained widespread recognition for her roles in The Princess Diaries (2001) and its 2004 sequel as a young girl who discovers she is a member of royalty, opposite Julie Andrews and Heather Matarazzo.

She also had a notable role in Nicholas Nickleby (2002) opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, and a starring role in Ella Enchanted (2004). A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Hathaway was reportedly a front-runner for the role of "Christine" in the 2004 The Phantom of the Opera (2004). However, due to scheduling conflicts with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she couldn\'t take the role, which was later given to newcomer Emmy Rossum.

Hathaway soon started to move away from family-friendly films. Following The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she appeared topless in the films Havoc (2005) opposite Josh Peck and Brokeback Mountain (2005) opposite Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.',

He\'s treated audiences to his comedic abilities with films like Dogma, {{Galaxy Quest}} and The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy.',

Spielberg\'s first major directorial effort was The Sugarland Express (1974), with Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: {{Jaws (1975)}}. He hit gold yet one more time with {{Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)}}, with Harrison Ford taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was {{Poltergeist (1982)}}, but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).',

As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.

Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005), for which he was nominated for an Oscar and a B.A.F.T.A. Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. After his death he received more than thirty posthumous awards for his portrayal as the psychopathic clown prince of crime in The Dark Knight (2008) (including the Oscar, S.A.G., B.A.F.T.A., and Golden Globe)',

She is the only child of Avner Hershlag, an Israeli-born doctor, and Shelley Stevens, an American-born artist (from Cincinnati, Ohio), who also acts as Natalie\'s agent. She left Israel for Washington, D.C., when she was still very young. After a few more moves, her family finally settled in New York, where she still lives to this day. 

She graduated with honors, and her academic achievements allowed her to attend Harvard University. She was discovered by an agent in a pizza parlor at the age of 11. She was pushed towards a career in modeling but she decided that she would rather pursue a career in acting. She was featured in many live performances, but she made her powerful film debut in the movie LÃ©on.

Following this role Natalie won roles in such films as Heat, Beautiful Girls, and Mars Attacks!. She received an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Black Swan.',

Acting was not a focus until she was accepted at the city&#039;s distinguished Goodman Theatre. She performed on stages around the city before heading to New York City in the early 1960s. In New York, her first stage role was in &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;. She won an Obie Award for her next performance in the play &quot;In White America&quot;, where she portrayed 27 different characters. Life Magazine dedicated a two-page article on Foster. More roles followed as her fans grew in number; quite often, roles were being written expressly for her. By the end of her career, she would win 2 more Obies, for a later performance of &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; and the Broadway production of &quot;Having Our Say&quot; in 1995. Foster&#039;s first film role was in The Cool World (1963); during production set met actor-director Clarence Williams III, and the couple soon married.

In addition, he enrolled at Wayne State University to further develop his writing and acting skills and found time to establish the Actors&#039; Emsemble Theatre, where he and other talented young black writers directed and appeared in their own works. After graduating with a B.A. from Wayne State, he was rewarded a full scholarship to the M.F.A. program at the prestigious Yale School of Drama. While performing with the school&#039;s repertory company, he was asked to appear in the Los Angeles production of Lonne Elder III&#039;s musical &quot;Daddy Goodness,&quot; which led to his meeting Gordon Parks, who gave Hudson the costarring role in his first feature film, Leadbelly (1976). Unfortunately, all that followed &quot;Leadbelly&quot; was a year of &quot;bit parts and some harsh lessons about Hollywood,&quot; which led Hudson to enroll in another academic doctorate program at the University of Minnesota. He did not complete the program. Through his experience, he learned another vital lesson: &quot;There are those who spend their lives studying it and those who spend their lives doing it.&quot; Hudson definitely wanted to be in the second group. Keeping in mind this self-revelation, Hudson accepted the starring role of Jack Jefferson in the Minneapolis Theatre In The Round&#039;s production of &quot;The Great White Hope,&quot; a role that he put &quot;everything he had into,&quot; including shaving his head. A series of starring and guest roles followed on such television shows as Fantasy Island (1977), The Incredible Hulk (1978), Little House on the Prairie (1974), Diff&#039;rent Strokes (1978), Taxi (1978), One Day at a Time (1975), Gimme a Break!

Chow as born in 1955 on the quiet island of Lamma, part of the then-British colony of Hong Kong, near its famous Victoria Harbour. His mother was a vegetable farmer and cleaning lady, and his father worked on a Shell Oil Company tanker. Chow&#039;s family moved to urban Hong Kong in 1965 and in early 1973, Chow attended a casting call for TVB, a division of Shaw Bros. productions. With his good looks and easy-going style, Chow was originally a heartthrob actor in non-demanding TV and film roles. However, his popularity increased with his appearance as white-suited gangster Hui Man-Keung in the highly popular drama TV series Shang Hai tan (1983). In 1985, Chow started receiving acclaim for his work and scored the Golden Horse (Best Actor) Award in Taiwan and another Best Actor Award from the Asian Pacific Film Festival for his performance in Dang doi lai ming (1984). With these accolades, Chow came to the attention of Woo, who cast Chow in the fast-paced gangster film A Better Tomorrow (1986) (aka &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;). The rest, as they say, is history. The film was an enormous commercial success, and Chow&#039;s influence on young Asian males was not dissimilar to the adulation given to previous Asian film sensations such as Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. Nearly every young guy in Hong Kong ran out and bought himself a &quot;Mark Coat,&quot; as they became known--a long, heavy woolen coat worn by Chow in the movie (although it is is actually very unsuited to Hong Kong&#039;s hot and humid climate). Further hard-edged roles in more John Woo crime films escalated Chow&#039;s popularity even higher, and fans all over the world flocked to see A Better Tomorrow II (1987) (aka &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2&quot;), The Killer (1989) (aka &quot;The Killer&quot;), and Hard Boiled (1992) (aka &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;). With the phenomenal global interest in the HK action genre, Chow was enticed to the United States and appeared in The Replacement Killers (1998) with Mira Sorvino, The Corruptor (1999) with Mark Wahlberg, and, for a change of pace, in the often-filmed romantic tale of Anna and the King (1999). Chow then returned to the Asian cinema circuit and starred in the critically lauded kung fu epic Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) (aka &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;). His wide appeal can be seen in his &quot;boy next door&quot; type of personality and his ability to play such a broad spectrum of roles from a comedic buffoon to a lovestruck Romeo to a trigger-happy professional killer. A highly entertaining and gifted actor with dynamic on-screen presence, Chow continues to remain in strong demand in many film markets.',

In 1977, he and lyricist Jim Steinman released an operatic rock album called &quot;Bat Out Of Hell&quot;, the record was huge and has sold 35,000,000 copies worldwide. However, the tour promoting the album took a toll on Meat&#039;s voice and left him unable to sing on the follow-up record &quot;Bad For Good&quot;. Meat Loaf stayed in the dark through the eighties doing 4 records which never got any airplay or chart position in the US. Meat Loaf appeared in films Out of Bounds (1986) as a Pilot, and The Squeeze (1987) with Michael Keaton. But after getting back together with Steinman, they delivered a powerful sequel &quot;Bat Out Of Hell II&quot; which went to #1 in the US and UK. Bat II has now sold an excess of 20,000,000 copies. His TV credits include the Soldier being held prisoner in Vietnam in Lightning Force (1991), a mad Doctor who invents a serum to keep zombies from deteriorating in Monsters (1988) and a slick Landlord of a restaurant who ends up on the menu in HBO series Tales from the Crypt (1989).

He is one of six children and even at the young age of five was on stage in his school show enjoying acting and singing. After failing a school exam at the age of eleven, Jeremy seemed destined for the acting profession and was soon attending Corona Academy Drama School, making his first professional appearance at the age of twelve when he appeared in a commercial for a breakfast cereal. Following many appearances on children&#039;s television, Jeremy&#039;s big break came at the age of 17 when he landed a major role in the musical film Summer Holiday (1963) which starred the pop idol Cliff Richard (now Sir Cliff). Shortly after, he went into a BBC soap opera called The Newcomers (1965) which ran for three years and made him a household name in the United Kingdom. In 1969, Jeremy was off to Madrid in Spain to play the leading role in a musical film called Las leandras (1969). This was followed by two major films: The Virgin and the Gypsy (1970) and Mary, Queen of Scots (1971). During the 1970s, he made many other screen appearances, including the James Bond films, in which he portrayed the character &#039;Smithers&#039; (Q&#039;s assistant). In 1977, Jeremy spent six months in the Far East, where he was based in Singapore and travelled to the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia filming a BBC drama documentary called &#039;The Sadrina Project&#039;. This documentary was designed to teach the English language to people in the Far East, mainly the Chinese. On a trip to China some 15 years later, where Jeremy was performing in a stage play, he was instantly recognised by hundreds of people who said they had learnt their English from the Sadrina Project. In 1978, he was starring in the television comedy series Agony (1979), which was co-written by an American called Len Richmond. It was during this series that Jeremy was asked to play a small part in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). The part, of course, was Boba Fett - proving the old theatrical saying that &quot;there is no such thing as a small part&quot;! Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) soon followed and Jeremy was invited to reprise the role of Boba. Since the early 1980s, Jeremy has played many roles on television and on the stage in London&#039;s West End. He has also done two worldwide theatre tours covering the Middle and Far East. Jeremy appeared regularly in the favourite television series Robin Hood (1984), in which he played the part of Edward of Wickham. Jeremy&#039;s son Robbie was asked to play Matthew in the series. &#039;Robin of Sherwood&#039; has a great following all around the world, and Jeremy attends the convention &#039;Spirit of Sherwood&#039; in Novi, Michigan every year, work permitting. Another popular series he has appeared in is Doctor Who (1963) where he played Hal the Archer in &#039;The Time Warrior&#039; with Jon Pertwee, and also Tor in the &#039;Space Museum&#039; with William Hartnell as the Doctor. Since the re-release of Star Wars in 1997, the interest in the character of Boba Fett has meant that Jeremy has been invited to many sci-fi conventions and events all around the world. His fan mail has increased five-fold, and he manages somehow to reply to everyone that writes to him. In the little leisure time he has left, he loves nothing more than a game of cricket with his friends. Jeremy also enjoys travelling; in the past few years he has spent more time abroad than at home. He has collected an awesome amount of Boba Fett memorabilia, some given to him by dedicated fans, and some he cannot resist buying at toy fairs. His office at home resembles a Boba Fett museum. Jeremy has three grown-up sons, and lives in London with his wife Maureen, and lucky black cat &#039;Percy&#039;.',

It was in 1930 that he made his first film appearance in Caste (1930). His most notable film roles of this period were as an aspiring actor opposite Miriam Hopkins and Rex Harrison in the Alexander Korda produced Men Are Not Gods (1936); as a crime suspect in another Korda production, Murder on Diamond Row (1937) and a role opposite Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson in Michael Powell&#039;s The Spy in Black (1939). His later films included a role in Roy Boulting&#039;s documentary-style Journey Together (1945); La montagne de verre (1949) and as a Scottish MP in Scotch on the Rocks (1953). In the 1960s, he appeared in Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo&#039;s imaginative It Happened Here (1965), made in semi-documentary style showing Britons coping during a Nazi persecution. Mostly stage and television work followed (including an appearance as a judge in Rumpole of the Bailey (1978)). In 1982, Shaw was approached by George Lucas to make an appearance in the final episode of his Star Wars films - Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983). The role was the small but crucial one at the film&#039;s climax of the unmasked Darth Vader and later as the disembodied spirit of Anakin Skywalker. The role has since made him a cult figure all over the world. The rest of Shaw&#039;s career was largely spent playing distinguished elderly gent roles such as the art critic Mr. Sharpe in High Season (1987). Shaw continued to act on stage, film and television well into his eighties. Sebastian Shaw died at age 89 of natural causes on December 23, 1994.',
